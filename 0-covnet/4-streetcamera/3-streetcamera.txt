I added in the street camera and I am getting none of the as errors.
I just did the street camera by itself, and guess what, I am getting some lumination errors.  Looks like a drop on the window is messing with it. 

1.. Should I get a different training set. 
2.. structure vs luminosity?  I want structure. 
3.. what about some sort of line detection first to get out some structure?
