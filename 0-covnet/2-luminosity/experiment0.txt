Okay, a quick retool for MSE.
And, yeah, it worked much better.   Really did a great job of reconstructing the images. Felt like there was a clear distinction between anonolays and normies.
However, there was still a halo effect, and the mse term seemed to be just the same at the border between anomlays and normies. 

Overall, pretty good.  ChatGPT has convinced me that mse will over-penalize brightness errors.  Which is fine in our case, but may not be good
when I go general.   Hrm.....

At any rate, next experiment will be with luminosity weighed l1.  I was surprised at how quickly even I could code it up. 

Okay, weighted luminosity was the the clearwinner.  3 separate groupings with the last being almost entirely perfect anamolies.   There was some trouble
in the trail, but nothing to worry about.

So, we decided that we may want to see how this classifier works on other cameras

And on motion in the street.   What else? I dunno.  Definitely quality of life improvements.  What would playing around with other architectures get me?
Nothing, right now.   I guess I could try larger chennels.
