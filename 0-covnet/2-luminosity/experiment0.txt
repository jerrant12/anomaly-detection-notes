Okay, a quick retool for MSE.
And, yeah, it worked much better.   Really did a great job of reconstructing the images. Felt like there was a clear distinction between anonolays and normies.
However, there was still a halo effect, and the mse term seemed to be just the same at the border between anomlays and normies. 

Overall, pretty good.  ChatGPT has convinced me that mse will over-penalize brightness errors.  Which is fine in our case, but may not be good
when I go general.   Hrm.....

At any rate, next experiment will be with luminosity weighed l1.  I was surprised at how quickly even I could code it up.
