-what a function is doing
-should I make our functions smart or angry
-figuring out the size of the image shouldn't be that garbage
-increased back channels -- doing that, so far, 32 seems best. 
-new architexture
-some sort of graphical exploerer 
-new ideas other than the autoencoder,
 -- I think I decided to use an object detector, and then, use anomaly detection on the results of the detection.
-add chickens
-use some data from the street camera
-experiment with dataset - should I add jitter and noise to the training set? 
   -- should I combine data sets.
     
-some sort of filter on the final output.   Like you have to have thresholds on either side of you to activate.  
-make my loss functions more generic so I can plug and play. I would also like to plug and play reconstruction.
