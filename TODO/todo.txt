// DONE or put off
-add comments -- done
-what a function is doing -- done
-should I make our functions smart or angry -- put it off...our friend added reasonable backups
-figuring out the size of the image shouldn't be that garbage..turns out it wasn't
-increased back channels -- doing that, so far, 32 seems best.  -- doing this.  
-new architexture (like what would I do? And why, it seems to be working, and I kinda want to go other places right now.  But easily visit this as needed)

-some sort of graphical exploerer  (something to think about)
-new ideas other than the autoencoder,
 -- I think I decided to use an object detector, and then, use anomaly detection on the results of the detection.
-allow multiple data sets


// Next
-add chickens
-use some data from the street camera
-experiment with dataset - should I add jitter and noise to the training set? 
   -- should I combine data sets.
     
-some sort of filter on the final output.   Like you have to have thresholds on either side of you to activate.  
-make my loss functions more generic so I can plug and play. :wq -- did that.  The reconstruction banner thing had to be pretty common
   unless I passed a fish tone of functions or line or something.......feels like too much......A
   I would also like to plug and play reconstruction.
